Because the delivery of journalism has been largely unchanged for lengthy periods of time – newspapers for hundreds of years, television and radio for less – there’s been little experimentation with the fundamental delivery of news and information. But the web sets fire to many of the foundations of media delivery systems. Gone are the days of needing millions of dollars for presses, trucks, antennae, FCC licenses, etc. Now, anyone with an idea and the will to make it can be a media mogul. This class is going to be about building new forms of communication, with respect to the past and a sprint into the future."

  description: "The economics of digital publishing technology have opened a floodgate of raw data, and journalism is just one of many fields that are being rapidly transformed by that floodgate. In law, medicine, business, politics, and ecology, people are using data to understand the social and natural worlds. They are also using data to tell stories. To retain their position as brokers of trust and hubs of community conversation, reporters must understand how the people they cover are using data, and how journalists can use data to improve our shared understand of an increasingly complex world. Your decision to take this course indicates that you are interested in learning the skills an concepts of data-driven reporting. My expectation is that you already have demonstrated clear news judgment and precise, brief storytelling either in or out of a classroom. The class starts from the assumption that you’ve never or rarely used even a basic spreadsheet to aid either your reporting or storytelling. That’s where the semester will begin. We will end just shy of an introduction to how computer programming and algorithms are using journalistic data to create new editorial products."

Students will then spend time thinking through representations of core data types like time, location, text, image, sound and relationships (or networks), and the computational affordances associated with each. They will study common metaphors for organizing and storing data — from structureless key-value stores, to relational databases. We will also discuss ideas behind publishing or sharing data, moving from HTML documents and Web 1.0, to data services and APIs in Web 2.0, to semantics in Web 3.0. These efforts will be project-driven, using and building modern data services with a scripting language. Projects will underscore the reality that data are plentiful and circulate and interact in an informational ecosystem. As researchers, students will be called on to access and publish data products."

  description: "Algorithms are at the heart of computer processing - they are descriptions of computation. We will present a basic taxonomy of algorithms based on their purpose and discuss complexity (will an algorithm take a lot of time or require significant system resources?). Classes will be anchored around several algorithms developed for or by the digital humanities, computational social science, computational journalism, architecture, and other fields. Examples might include some aspect of natural language processing, computer vision, or statistical/machine learning. Students will learn a process of questioning computation and its artifacts, of examining an algorithm and assessing its capabilities and its biases: How does it function? What are its implicit assumptions? How should we test its operation? What does it leave out? In the process, students will also learn best practices for writing, documenting and publishing algorithms and code."

  description: "This course begins with the idea that computing tools are the products of human ingenuity and effort. They are never neutral and carry with them the biases of their designers and their design process. 'Platform studies' is a new term used to describe investigations into these relationships between computing technologies and the creative or research products that they help to generate. How you understand how data, code, and algorithms effect creative practices can be an effective first step toward critical thinking about technology. This will not be purely theoretical, however, and specific case studies, technologies, and project work will make the ideas concrete."

  description: "This is about seeing the structure of a data set. These structures are stories. We will start with fairly traditional storytelling tools, from simple descriptive statistics to graphical representations of data. Students will learn projective methods (marginal scatter plots, the Grand Tour, Principal Components) for seeing structures. Throughout, we will present the strengths and limitations of these data presentations. We emphasize that data have no 'natural' visual representation and that every view is some kind of reduction. Students will use existing views and create new views of data through a series of longer projects. This is about 'doing' and we will take as inspiration a raft of creative practices that produce visuals from data - in design, media art, architecture, geography, mathematics."

  description: "Traditional newspaper journalists had no need to learn how to operate the printing presses. Or to understand strategies the Marketing and Circulation departments used to promote and distribute their work. Their interactions with readers were one-sided at best, antisocial at worst, and computers were treated as glorified word processors. The Internet blew that world up. Mobile technologies are shaking it yet again. This course will explore the mind-sets and skill-sets of digital journalism, covering website development and design; data analysis and visualization; search engine and social media strategies; audience engagement; mobile platforms; and web analytics."

  description: "This is a skills-based, capstone course designed to enhance reporting skills, primarily by identifying and analyzing electronic data to look for patterns and trends that can lead to in-depth news stories. Students will obtain and analyze digital data for computer-assisted reporting that can be published on various media platforms Students will use spreadsheets and databases to manage information, find news stories, and produce graphics. Although students will spend a great deal of time learning how to use Microsoft Excel and Access software, this is not a class about computer programs; it's a class about good reporting practices. Learning the software is just one way to become a better reporter."

  time_period: Summer 2011
  description: "The objective of this course is to familiarize students with digital tools that will become the frameworks with which they can approach storytelling, emphasizing the use of structured data and the visualization of data to aid in the understanding of complex information. The course establishes a deep understanding of the basic principles with which government collects and distributes information, with an emphasis on a new set of tools, dubbed Gov. 2.0, that’s allowing the public greater access to and interaction with data than ever before. Students will use visualization tools to find the story hidden in the data and then apply that by determining the most appropriate platform for storytelling that will engage an audience. The course will highlight emerging database tools and familiarize students with how to design interfaces that can differentiate their reporting. While students will examine a variety of government data, they will spend most of their time working with data involving politics and the 2010 Census. These will be obtained from a variety of sources official and unofficial. The final project described below will encompass some or all of the datasets we work with in class, but the students will choose their own areas of focus."

  description: "The world that we live in and report on is increasingly influenced by data. This course will help you use data to find and develop stories that can’t be found in other ways. Data can be anything: spreadsheets full of numbers, the text of speeches or the measured observations of daily life. Reporters need to be able to treat data as another source to be researched, interviewed and analyzed, using the right tool for the job. Beginning with spreadsheets and continuing to databases, basic mapping and rudimentary programming, this class will make working with data a part of your skill set. This is a skills-based course, so students will need to be comfortable with learning to use computer software beyond word processors. If you are wondering if you can do this stuff, you can. You may prefer interviewing people to data, but avoiding data - particularly for Washington journalists - is no longer an option."

  description: "This course is an introduction to programming concepts as they relate to the journalism industry. The goal of this course is to equip students with a foundational technical literacy to construct interactive online stories such as data visualizations, infographics, maps, multimedia packages, games or innumerable other types of projects students may conceive. Students will learn the basics of JavaScript—the language of the web. They will learn the fundamentals of prototypical object oriented programming, an important component in many web coding languages. The course will cover variables, typecasting, arrays, for-loops, conditional statements, comparison operators, functions, enclosures and cross-domain data requesting. This course will also cover popular data libraries like D3 and Leaflet. While these terms may seem esoteric to a layperson, they need to be part of the vernacular of students wishing to enhance their abilities in this expanding area of journalism."
