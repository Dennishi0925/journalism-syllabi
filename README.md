# journalism-syllabi

This is a collection of computational and data journalism courses for which there's a __publicly available__ homepage or syllabus to use as a reference.  I started compiling this list before arriving at Stanford in 2014. In June 2016, I uploaded it here  and made a few updates, but it's not complete or consistent by any means. It includes a few not-really computational/journalism courses, which I may edit out later. As I have time, I try to serialize various aspects of each course (see [some-syllabi.yaml](some-syllabi.yaml) for all the data fields), such as which textbooks are used and what specific skills are taught.

A simplified HTML rendering of [some-syllabi.yaml](some-syllabi.yaml) is at the [end of this README](#table-courses); I'll make it a Jekyll site later.


For investigative journalism syllabi, the [Investigative Journalism Education Consortium maintains](http://ijec.org/) a list here:  http://ijec.org/syllabi/

[Investigative Reporters & Editors](https://ire.org/) also maintains a collection: https://ire.org/resource-center/educators-center/syllabi/


Feel free to add suggestions in the [issues](https://github.com/dannguyen/journalism-syllabi/issues).



### Course collection

The following table is auto-generated from running [scripts/produce_courselist.py](scripts/produce_courselist.py), which reads from [some-syllabi.yaml](some-syllabi.yaml) and prints things exactly in the order as I entered them in (i.e. with no real order at all -- will export to a proper Github Pages/Jekyll thing later):

<a id="table-courses"></a>

There are currently <strong>92</strong> courses listed; see [some-syllabi.yaml](some-syllabi.yaml) for more data fields.
